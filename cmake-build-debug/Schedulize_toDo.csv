Then you’ll reflect on your camerawork through small-group discussions. When viewing the lectures and doing the assigned reading for this module pay close attention to the various photographic practices and modes of fiction-based photography discussed considering them as starting points for your photography projects. \n\n Instructions\n-------------\n\nInitial Post\n------------\n\nThe goal of this project is for you to produce extraordinary fiction-based photography which you will then discuss with your groupmates. You should begin by looking back over the artists’ work mentioned in our text and lectures and think about which fictional approaches resonate with you. You may want to try multiple methods and you will undoubtedly need to take many many photographs before you settle on your best image to post for this project. \n\nWhen considering your chosen photograph and writing your artist statement you will want to consider your content\; why did you choose or invent your subject? What is your photography saying about it? Also as the photographer you need to think about your photography's relationship not only to photographic examples from class but also to your formal instincts regarding composition the center of interest the interplay of shadow and light as well as the potential interpretations of objects/scenes within the image.\n\nFollow-up Responses\n-------------------\n\nOnce your project is fully posted participate in a robust graded small-group discussion about your camerawork and the work of your fellow group mates. After you make an initial post please respond to the work of your peers.\n\nTo help get your conversation started here are some discussion topics to consider including content concept and composition:\n\n* Are the photographer's ideas/concepts/compositional intentions discernible in this photograph?\n\n* What can we determine about this photograph from the information presented in this image? What has been invented for this project and why?\n\n* How does the fictional element of the project affect the ‘truth claim’ of the image?\n\n* How does your interpretation/impression of the photograph relate to the artist’s statement provided by the photographer? \n\n* Describe your general feelings about the composition of this photograph. Does it feel active to you? Does it feel static and calm? Does it feel majestic or desolate? Why?\n\n* How do those compositional concerns relate to the photographer’s chosen subject matter? \n\n* Describe the formal qualities of this photograph.  \n\n* Do all of the compositional elements mentioned above appear thoughtfully considered? Haphazard? Consistent with the artist's statement?\n\n  Submission Guidelines\n-----------------------\n\nFor each project you must upload three things to the project discussion board:\n\n* The link to the photo album for your project showing all the images you produced for the project (both good and not so good). Aim for 30 images.\n\n* Your best photograph. Choose your most interesting engaging solution to the inherent problems of each project. You can add this image directly to the discussion board for your group-mates to actively discuss.\n\n* Your concise artist statement. The artist statement should be one or two paragraphs describing your ideas intentions choice of composition and/or decision-making process for each project. Keep the statement brief and straightforward thinking of it as a way to quickly orient first-time viewers to your work as well as a way to clarify your thoughts on the project. \n\nNote: If you fail to upload any of these three things you will not get any credit for participating in the project.\n\nPost your projects by the second Tuesday of each module followed immediately by candid and open discussions. The earlier you begin your group discussions/responses the more likely you will develop the sort of sustained fruitful conversations that will eventually lead to better photography (not to mention a better participation grade). Waiting until the last moment to comment on everyone’s work essentially salts the soil of conversation making it impossible for any real discussion to crop up. Start commenting and asking questions early and come back often to respond. \n\n Grading\n--------\n\nYour work will be evaluated based on the criteria presented in the discussion grading rubric which you can access by clicking the three-dotted options button [[three dots] (https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/452207/files/65402138/download?verifier=rnSor4avlZ38wAmdFrtLxd1c4aBx0ZKbILRgQ4Wt)] in the top-right corner of this page and selecting "Show Rubric."

Module 1: Discussion Closes , ART1010C, 1/23, 1, --------------------------\nModule 1Project Discussion\n--------------------------\n\n  Purpose of This Activity\n--------------------------\n\nThe purpose of this assignment is to synthesize this module’s reading and lectures — including the conceptual framework provided by John Szarkowski and examples from the history of photography — in order to produce a photographic response that will serve as the basis of a discussion reflecting on your photographic practice. \n\n Overview\n---------\n\nIn this course we learn how to think about and discuss photography to produce better photographs. It is the first of many projects that will help you to transition from concept to practice as you will build each photographic project on the history and theories of photography presented in our readings and lectures followed by a robust graded discussion about your camerawork.\n\nThis project is the first of several assignments for which you will synthesize the content of lectures and readings to produce photographs and then reflect on your camerawork through small-group discussions. Importantly the conceptual framework covered in this module provides a common set of concerns that will be used throughout the semester to analyze and discuss photographs.\n\n Instructions\n-------------\n\nInitial Post\n------------\n\nIn the first part of this module we analyzed examples from the history of photography using a framework developed by the theorist and curator John Szarkowski. Specifically we discussed Szarkowski's five photographic issues: The Thing Itself The Detail The Frame Time and Vantage Point. \n\nThe goal of this project is for you to plan out produce and discuss photographs that exemplify some of these five issues. You should begin by looking back over the work of photographers mentioned in the text and lectures and think about which approaches resonate with you. You may want to try multiple approaches and you will certainly need to take many many images before you settle on your best photograph to post for this project. \n\nAs with all photography you will want to consider your content\; why did you choose your subject matter/location and what is your photograph saying about it? Also as the photographer it is important for you to think about your photograph's relationship not only to Szarkowski's five issues but also to your own instincts regarding composition the center of interest interplay of shadow and light as well as the potential interpretations of objects within the image. \n\nFollow-up Responses\n-------------------\n\nOnce your project is fully posted here participate in a robust graded small-group discussion about your camerawork and the work of your fellow group mates. After you make an initial post please respond to all of your groupmates.\n\nTo help get your conversation started here are some discussion topics to consider including content concept and composition:\n\n* Which of Szarkowski's five issues are most evident in this image? Which are least evident?\n\n* Are the photographer's ideas/concepts/compositional intentions discernible in this image?\n\n* What can we determine about this photograph from the information presented in this photograph?\n\n* How does your interpretation/impression of the image relate to the artist's statement provided by the photographer?\n\n* Describe the formal qualities of this photograph. How do they relate to Szarkowski's five photographic issues: The Thing Itself\, The Detail The Frame Time and Vantage Point.\n\n* Describe your general feelings about the composition of this photograph. Does it feel active to you? Does it feel static and calm? Does it feel majestic or desolate? Why?\n\n* Do all of the compositional elements mentioned above appear thoughtfully considered? Haphazard? Consistent with the artist's statement?\n\n  Submission Guidelines\n-----------------------\n\nFor each project you must upload three things to the project discussion board:\n\n* The link to the Flickr photo album for your project showing all the images you produced for the project (both good and not so good). Aim for 30 images.\n\n* Your best photograph. Choose your most interesting engaging solution to the inherent problems of each project. You can add this image directly to the discussion board for your group-mates to full-throatedly discuss.\n\n* Your concise artist statement. The artist statement should be one or two paragraphs describing your ideas intentions choice of composition and/or decision-making process for each project. Keep the statement brief and straightforward thinking of it as a way to quickly orient first-time viewers to your work as well as a way to clarify your own thoughts on the project. \n\nNote: If you fail to upload any of these three things you will not get any credit for participating in the project.\n\nPost your projects by the second Tuesday of each module followed immediately by candid and open discussions. The earlier you begin your group discussions/responses the more likely you will develop the sort of sustained fruitful conversations that will eventually lead to better photography (not to mention a better participation grade). Waiting until the last moment to comment on everyone’s work essentially salts the soil of conversation making it impossible for any real discussion to crop up.

Begin Project 1 Discussion , ART1010C, 1/19, 1, 
Upload Day Project 1 , ART1010C, 1/18, 1, --------------------------\nModule 1Project Discussion\n--------------------------\n\n  Purpose of This Activity\n--------------------------\n\nThe purpose of this assignment is to synthesize this module’s reading and lectures — including the conceptual framework provided by John Szarkowski and examples from the history of photography — in order to produce a photographic response that will serve as the basis of a discussion reflecting on your photographic practice. \n\n Overview\n---------\n\nIn this course we learn how to think about and discuss photography to produce better photographs. It is the first of many projects that will help you to transition from concept to practice as you will build each photographic project on the history and theories of photography presented in our readings and lectures followed by a robust graded discussion about your camerawork.\n\nThis project is the first of several assignments for which you will synthesize the content of lectures and readings to produce photographs and then reflect on your camerawork through small-group discussions. Importantly the conceptual framework covered in this module provides a common set of concerns that will be used throughout the semester to analyze and discuss photographs.\n\n Instructions\n-------------\n\nInitial Post\n------------\n\nIn the first part of this module we analyzed examples from the history of photography using a framework developed by the theorist and curator John Szarkowski. Specifically we discussed Szarkowski's five photographic issues: The Thing Itself The Detail The Frame Time and Vantage Point. \n\nThe goal of this project is for you to plan out produce and discuss photographs that exemplify some of these five issues. You should begin by looking back over the work of photographers mentioned in the text and lectures and think about which approaches resonate with you. You may want to try multiple approaches and you will certainly need to take many many images before you settle on your best photograph to post for this project. \n\nAs with all photography you will want to consider your content\; why did you choose your subject matter/location and what is your photograph saying about it? Also as the photographer it is important for you to think about your photograph's relationship not only to Szarkowski's five issues but also to your own instincts regarding composition the center of interest interplay of shadow and light as well as the potential interpretations of objects within the image. \n\nFollow-up Responses\n-------------------\n\nOnce your project is fully posted here participate in a robust graded small-group discussion about your camerawork and the work of your fellow group mates. After you make an initial post please respond to all of your groupmates.\n\nTo help get your conversation started here are some discussion topics to consider including content concept and composition:\n\n* Which of Szarkowski's five issues are most evident in this image? Which are least evident?\n\n* Are the photographer's ideas/concepts/compositional intentions discernible in this image?\n\n* What can we determine about this photograph from the information presented in this photograph?\n\n* How does your interpretation/impression of the image relate to the artist's statement provided by the photographer?\n\n* Describe the formal qualities of this photograph. How do they relate to Szarkowski's five photographic issues: The Thing Itself\, The Detail The Frame Time and Vantage Point.\n\n* Describe your general feelings about the composition of this photograph. Does it feel active to you? Does it feel static and calm? Does it feel majestic or desolate? Why?\n\n* Do all of the compositional elements mentioned above appear thoughtfully considered? Haphazard? Consistent with the artist's statement?\n\n  Submission Guidelines\n-----------------------\n\nFor each project you must upload three things to the project discussion board:\n\n* The link to the Flickr photo album for your project showing all the images you produced for the project (both good and not so good). Aim for 30 images.\n\n* Your best photograph. Choose your most interesting engaging solution to the inherent problems of each project. You can add this image directly to the discussion board for your group-mates to full-throatedly discuss.\n\n* Your concise artist statement. The artist statement should be one or two paragraphs describing your ideas intentions choice of composition and/or decision-making process for each project. Keep the statement brief and straightforward thinking of it as a way to quickly orient first-time viewers to your work as well as a way to clarify your own thoughts on the project. \n\nNote: If you fail to upload any of these three things you will not get any credit for participating in the project.\n\nPost your projects by the second Tuesday of each module followed immediately by candid and open discussions. The earlier you begin your group discussions/responses the more likely you will develop the sort of sustained fruitful conversations that will eventually lead to better photography (not to mention a better participation grade). Waiting until the last moment to comment on everyone’s work essentially salts the soil of conversation making it impossible for any real discussion to crop up. Start commenting and asking questions early and come back often to respond. \n\n Grading\n--------\n\nYour work will be evaluated based on the criteria presented in the discussion grading rubric which you can access by clicking the three-dotted options button [[three dots] (https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/452207/files/65402138/download?verifier=rnSor4avlZ38wAmdFrtLxd1c4aBx0ZKbILRgQ4Wt)] in the top-right corner of this page and selecting "Show Rubric."

Module 1: Quiz , ART1010C, 1/14, 1, ------------\nModule 1Quiz\n------------\n\nQuiz Purpose\n------------\n\nThis quiz assesses your understanding of the content delivered in the module's lectures and readings including your ability to identify the five photographic issues developed by John Szarkowski in his text The Photographer's Eye and apply them to the examples presented in the textbook and lectures.\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nAfter you study all module 1 learning materials take this quiz. You will have 15 minutes to respond to 10 questions. You will have only one attempt so please review the content if needed. \n\nHere is a hint or suggestion for taking these quizzes: While you won't need to know exact dates you will often have to identify the work of specific artists particular photographic movements and modes time periods early photographic processes and theories of understanding photography discussed in the readings and lectures. I strongly recommend you jot down key terms along with all names and titles mentioned in the textbook and lectures and brief descriptions of the work of each photographer discussed. Since these are 15-minute quizzes you will not have enough time to comb through the text and lectures in order to retrieve names and terms so your notes will prove invaluable to you if used in concert with a thorough review before each quiz.\n\n[  Return to Module Activities] (https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/452207/pages/module-1-the-photographers-eye)
